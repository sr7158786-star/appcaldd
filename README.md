- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Camera**: HTML5 Media API
- **Storage**: localStorage

## Food Recognition

The app includes a mock food recognition system that:
- Analyzes image colors to identify potential food types
- Contains a database of common foods with nutritional information
- Simulates processing time for realistic user experience

In a production environment, this would be replaced with:
- Google Vision API
- Clarifai Food Recognition
- Custom ML models (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- FoodVisor API
- Nutritionix API
